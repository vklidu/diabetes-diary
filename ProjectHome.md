The number of patients suffering from diabetes mellitus is increasing and this is a long-termed development. This thesis deals with a minimum model of glucose and insulin interaction in a body containing type 1 diabetes mellitus. The model was implemented within the scope of diabetic diary which is a program for a diabetic to file all the data related to his or her disease.

Moreover, one chapter regards glykozyled hemoglobin and the possibility of its estimation based on the middle value of blood sugar. In the thesis, faults and possible improvements of the minimum model have been discussed.

The created program should help diabetics better understand their disease and complicated metabolic processes in their bodies and thus contribute to better diabetes compensation. The system is implemented in Java and is subject to GPL version 2 license.
